# IMPLEMENTING THE BINARY SEARCH RECURSSIVELY 
# AND EXPLAINING ITS TIME COMPLEXITY - O(LOG(N))

# RECURSIVE BINARY SEARCH IS AN ALGORITHM THAT FINDS A TARGET ELEMENT FROM A SORTED
#  ARRAY BY REPEATEDLY DIVIDING THE SEARCH INTERVAL IN HALF USING RECURSSION.

def binarySearch(arr, key, low, high):  # DEFINING THE MAIN RECURSSIVE BINARY SEARCH FUNCTION

    # arr - sorted array
    # key - value to find
    # low - starting index
    # high - ending index

    if low > high:  # base case - 1
        # if low > high - means empty range
        print(f"Key {key} NOT FOUND")
        return -1  # give -1 i.e. standard convention
    
    mid = low + (high - low) // 2  # finding the middle index
    # if we find it like (low + high)//2 - overflow risk
    # safe method is low + (high-low)//2 - overflow avoided
    
    print(f"low={low}, high={high}, mid={mid}, arr[mid]={arr[mid]}") 
     # debug trance - shows every steps including current range + mid value
    
    if arr[mid] == key:  # base case -2 
        # found the key no more recurssion will return the index where it is found
        return mid
    
    elif arr[mid] > key:  
# key is smaller - left half search and size is halfed, new smaller range - (low,mid-1)
        return binarySearch(arr, key, low, mid-1)
    
    else:
# key is larger - right half search and again size is halfed (i.e. logarithmic reduction) , 
# new smaller range - (mid+1, high)
        return binarySearch(arr, key, mid+1, high)
